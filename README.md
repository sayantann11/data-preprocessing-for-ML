# data-preprocessing-for-ML
introduce the concepts that are used in data preprocessing, a major step in the Machine Learning Process. Let us start with defining what it is. What is Data Preprocessing? When we talk about data, we usually think of some large datasets with huge number of rows and columns. While that is a likely scenario, it is not always the case — data could be in so many different forms: Structured Tables, Images, Audio files, Videos etc.. Machines don’t understand free text, image or video data as it is, they understand 1s and 0s. So it probably won’t be good enough if we put on a slideshow of all our images and expect our machine learning model to get trained just by that! In any Machine Learning process, Data Preprocessing is that step in which the data gets transformed, or Encoded, to bring it to such a state that now the machine can easily parse it. In other words, the features of the data can now be easily interpreted by the algorithm. Features in Machine Learning A dataset can be viewed as a collection of data objects, which are often also called as a records, points, vectors, patterns, events, cases, samples, observations, or entities. Data objects are described by a number of features, that capture the basic characteristics of an object, such as the mass of a physical object or the time at which an event occurred, etc.. Features are often called as variables, characteristics, fields, attributes, or dimensions.
